# Basic Spam Filter Project
## Overview

This project is a basic spam filter aimed at detecting spam messages. It uses two filtering methods:

- A filter using the built-in CountVectorizer method.
- A filter using an alternative custom method that doesn't rely on CountVectorizer.

Features

- CountVectorizer Method: Uses the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert text data into numerical features, followed by classification.
- Custom Method: Implements a unique approach to text processing and classification without using the CountVectorizer, demonstrating flexibility and understanding of underlying concepts.
